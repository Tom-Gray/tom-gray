I rode through Highton to Buckley's Falls. It was an exploratory mission. It was the edge of the suburbs but I had never been there before so it still felt unexplored. I discovered paths and tracks, a weir. I felt like the only person for miles. A glance across the river or up the hill to a thousand houses disproved this but the feeling was there all the same.

My mind wandered. How far would I have to go to find somewhere truly unowned? Not somebody's farm or property, not a picnic ground cared for by a government department. Do any places exist that belong to nature and nobody else? Could I visit one? For no other purpose than to simply exist there for a time and experience the feeling of truly being the only human for miles.
